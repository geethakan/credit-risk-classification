# Supervised Learning - Logistic Regression Model
  
In this exercise, dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company is used to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.</div>

### Introduction
Supervised learning, also known as supervised machine learning, is a subcategory of machine learning and artificial intelligence. A computer algorithm is trained on input data that has been labeled for a particular output. The model is trained until it can detect the underlying patterns and relationships between the input data and the output labels, enabling it to yield accurate labeling results when presented with never-before-seen data. Supervised learning is good at classification and regression problems. 

 - A classification algorithm aims to sort inputs into a given number of categories or classes, based on the labeled data it was trained on. Classification algorithms can be used for binary classifications for eg. categorizing customer feedback as positive or negative, categorizing emails into spam or non-spam etc. 
 - Regression analysis is a powerful statistical method that allows one to examine the relationship between two or more variables of interest.  
 - Logistic regression is a statistical analysis method to predict a binary outcome, such as yes or no, based on prior observations of a data set.
